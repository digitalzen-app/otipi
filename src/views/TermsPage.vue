        <h1>Terms and Conditions for Otipi</h1>

        <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
        <p>
            By accessing or using the Otipi app, users agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions. If you do not
            agree with any part of these terms, you must not use this app.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
        <p>
            Otipi is a browser-based Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) app. It allows users to generate and manage
            One-Time Passwords (OTPs) securely across devices. The app stores
            your OTP seeds locally in an encrypted vault within your browser, with an optional feature to sync the vault
            to your personal Google Drive. Otipi is provided "as is"
            and is accessible without charge.
        </p>

        <h2>3. No Warranty</h2>
        <p>
            Otipi is provided without any warranties of any kind, either express or implied. We do not guarantee the
            accuracy, completeness, or reliability of the information and
            services offered. Users use the app at their own risk.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>
            To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, Otipi or its developers shall not be liable for any
            direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive
            damages resulting from the use or inability to use the service.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Modification of Terms</h2>
        <p>We reserve the right to modify these terms at any time. Users are advised to review the Terms and Conditions
            periodically for any changes.</p>

        <h2>6. Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>
            All intellectual property rights in the app and its content belong to us or our licensors. No part of the
            app may be used, copied, or exploited for commercial purposes
            without our express permission.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Governing Law</h2>
        <p>These Terms and Conditions shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Israel, without
            regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>

        <h2>8. Severability</h2>
        <p>If any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the remaining provisions
            will continue in effect.</p>

        <h2>9. DigitalZen.app Disclaimer</h2>
        <p>
            Our lawyers insisted we say this: <strong>DigitalZen.app has absolutely no liability, responsibility, or
                support for Otipi. Zero. Zilch. Nada.</strong> While we’re thrilled to share this side project with the
            community, we hope it brings value and convenience to your digital life. Please note that DigitalZen.app’s
            primary focus remains on productivity and blocking apps and websites.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you encounter any issues, please do not contact the DigitalZen.app support team. They don’t know a thing
            about this project (seriously, not a clue), and no support
            will be provided.
        </p>
